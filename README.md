# Python-v-Cpp
In this repository we will be taking up a series of simple and basic problems and compare the time taken by Python and C++ to solve each one. It is to be noted that we won't be using any additional third party libraries. We will give our best to make the programs as efficient as possible. The benchmarking will be done on the same laptop. The following is the link to the system specs: https://gist.github.com/DarkStar1997/0cc9fe831f1166db7af1711b2e0a4ce1
The platform used is Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon. The C++ compiler which is being used for the challenges is GCC 7.2.
